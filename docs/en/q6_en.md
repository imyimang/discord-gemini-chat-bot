## Choosing between different models in Gemini
Gemini released free versions 1.0 and 1.5, both of which are free to use. The relevant rate limits are as shown in the image below.

If you're using the free version, it's recommended to use 1.0. Although 1.5 has optimized models, its rate limits are quite strict.

To change the model, simply go to `call_api.py`
```py
...

model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-1.0-pro', generation_config=generation_config, safety_settings=safety_settings) 

image_model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-pro-vision', generation_config=generation_config, safety_settings=safety_settings)

...
```
This part

Change
```py
model_name='gemini-1.0-pro'
```
to
```py
model_name='gemini-1.5-pro'
```
You can make changes according to the model you want.
